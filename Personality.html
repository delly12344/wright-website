  <p> My strongest trait/emotion is the sheer amount of discipline I have when it comes to getting things done/achieving something.Once I set my mind,body and spirit towards a certain goal I WILL ACHIEVE IT.This mentality impacted my school/academic life in a way that I am more driven and not  dependent on motivation to do something but do it to do it.</p>
  <p> I donot like reading but through sheer discipline I was able to become Hanover reading competition parish champion. </p>

A sought after public speaker, he’s traveled the world sharing his philosophy on how to master the mind. Why I chose him as my hero is because of his mentality and speeches that really inspire me to keep pushing even when time's are hard. </p>

  <p>I believe the test has some general validity; however, it falls short in the sense that you cannot accurately determine someone's personality based solely on a few questions. Personality is complex and multifaceted, and while these tests might provide some insights, they are often too simplistic to capture the full depth of an individual's character and behavior.</p>
  <p>In my case in particular,I find myself to be quite the opposite of what the test results indicated. While these kinds of assessments can offer some interesting perspectives, they often fail to capture the nuances of an individual’s true personality. In my case, the traits identified by the test don't align with how I view myself or how I behave in real-life situations.</p>
